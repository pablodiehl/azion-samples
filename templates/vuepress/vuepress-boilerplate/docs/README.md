# VuePress Boilerplate

With the **VuePress Boilerplate** template, you can start a project using the [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) framework and deploy it to the edge in a few steps. The template also creates a GitHub repository containing your project, an edge application, and a domain to facilitate your access and management through the Azion Edge Platform. 

VuePress is a Markdown-centered static site generator that allows developers to write content (documentation, blogs, etc.) in Markdown and generates a static site to host it.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy the VuePress Boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/vuepress-boilerplate/) guide.
 
This template uses VuePress version `2.0.0`.

## Requirements

Before using this template, you need to:

- Have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).
 - Every push will be deployed automatically to the main branch in this repository to keep your project updated.

> **Note**: this template uses [Application Accelerator](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/), [Edge Functions](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/), and [Edge Cache](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-cache/) and it could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

Fill in the fields presented on the configuration form and deploy the template. This will create a new edge application with its configurations, which you can edit and manage later. It also creates a repository in your GitHub account, based on the template, allowing you to maintain control over the project.
