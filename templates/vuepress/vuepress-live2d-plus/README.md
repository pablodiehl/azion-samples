# VuePress Live2D Plus

The **VuePress Live2D Plus** template is a [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) documentation website starter kit that features an integrated [Live2D plugin](https://github.com/xinlei3166/vuepress-plugin-live2d-plus).

The deployment creates an edge application with customizable configurations, an **Edge Storage** origin for content delivery, and a GitHub repository based on the template to facilitate your access and management through the Azion Edge Platform.

This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy a web application based on VuePress using templates](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/vuepress-templates-collection/) guide.

This template uses VuePress version `2.0.0`.

> **Note**: this is a community template. It was created by third-party or external developers and Azion is only enabling the deployment in the Azion Edge Platform. Azion doesn't provide maintenance or support for the content itself but can assist you with any queries or issues you may encounter while deploying this template or using the platform.

## Requirements

Before using this template, you need to:

- Have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).
 - Every push will be deployed automatically to the main branch in this repository to keep your project updated.

> **Note**: this template uses [Application Accelerator](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/), [Edge Functions](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/), and [Edge Cache](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-cache/) and it could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

Fill in the fields presented on the configuration form and deploy the template. This will create a new edge application with its configurations, which you can edit and manage later. It also creates a repository in your GitHub account, based on the template, allowing you to maintain control over the project.
