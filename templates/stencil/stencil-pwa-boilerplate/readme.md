# Stencil PWA Boilerplate

With the **Stencil PWA Boilerplate** template, you can start a project using the [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/docs/introduction) framework in the [Ionic PWA](https://ionic.io/pwa) format, deploying it to the edge in just a few steps. The template also creates a GitHub repository containing your project, an edge application, and a domain to facilitate your access and management through the Azion Edge Platform.
 
Stencil, combined with the Ionic PWA toolkit, offers a robust solution for building fast, modern Progressive Web Apps. It provides tools to create reusable components, leverage modern web APIs, and deliver apps with native-like performance and offline capabilities.


This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy the Stencil PWA Boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/stencil-pwa-boilerplate/) guide.
 
This template uses Stencil version `4.17.0`.

## Requirements

Before using this template, you need to:

- Have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).
 - Every push will be deployed automatically to the main branch in this repository to keep your project updated.

> **Note**: this template uses [Application Accelerator](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/), [Edge Functions](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/), and [Edge Cache](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-cache/) and it could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

Fill in the fields presented on the configuration form and deploy the template. This will create a new edge application with its configurations, which you can edit and manage later. It also creates a repository in your GitHub account, based on the template, allowing you to maintain control over the project.
