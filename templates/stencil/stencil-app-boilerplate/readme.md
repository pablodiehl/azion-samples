# Stencil Boilerplate

The **Stencil Boilerplate** template deploys a basic Stencil (4.22.2) web application and creates basic Edge Applications configurations to optimize it, such as creating multiple Cache Settings, enabling the use of Gzip compression, etc. The template creates a GitHub repository containing your project, as well as an edge application and a domain to facilitate your access and management through Azion Edge Platform.

Stencil is a modern compiler for building reusable, scalable web components. It allows developers to easily write standard-compliant components, providing features like JSX, TypeScript, and lazy-loading while outputting highly optimized code for fast performance.


This repository is an example of the new GitHub repository created during the deployment. For a more detailed step-by-step to deploy this template through Azion's platform, check the [How to deploy edge applications with the Stencil Boilerplate](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/guides/stencil-boilerplate/) guide.

This template uses Stencil version `4.22.2`.

## Requirements

Before using this template, you need to:

- Have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup).
  - Every push will be deployed automatically to the main branch in this repository to keep your project updated.

> **Note**: this template uses [Application Accelerator](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/application-accelerator/), [Edge Functions](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/), and [Edge Cache](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-cache/) and it could generate usage-related costs. Check the [pricing page](https://www.azion.com/en/pricing/) for more information.

Fill in the fields presented on the configuration form and deploy the template. This will create a new edge application with its configurations, which you can edit and manage later. It also creates a repository in your GitHub account, based on the template, allowing you to maintain control over the project.
